### Scenario

In this project we are working as analysts for a real estate company. Our company "Luna Lovegood"  created a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

### Objective

The senior management of the real estate company also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tools. One of those parameters includes understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.
We followed this workflow in Python in order to build the required model:

### Approach

The dataset we used consists of information on 22,000 properties and contains historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015.
Our first approach consisted of:
                                * Importing the data
                                * Exploring the data (EDA Method)
                                * Data wrangling
                                * Data cleaning
                                * Check for multicolinearity
